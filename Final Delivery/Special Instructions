1. Copy and Paste the datasets everytime when you start a new Google Colab session. 
This is because Google Colab only caches files for each session but not permanently stores them on the cloud.
2. There are 4 variables to change: cases_death, vac, mode and prediction(). For the first two you need to change the file paths,
and for mode you need to specify either "visualization" or "prediction", and for prediction parameters DO NOT CHANGE the first 
parameter and change the second one to any number you wish to predict and the third to either "cases" or "deaths".
